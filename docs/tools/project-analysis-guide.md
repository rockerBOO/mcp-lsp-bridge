# Project Analysis Tool Guide

Comprehensive guide for the `project_analysis` tool - the most powerful analysis tool in the MCP-LSP Bridge.

## Overview

The `project_analysis` tool provides 9 different analysis types for deep codebase understanding, from individual file analysis to workspace-wide architectural assessment.

## Analysis Types

### 1. File Analysis (`file_analysis`)

Analyzes individual files for complexity metrics, structure, and code quality.

**Usage:**
```bash
● project_analysis (MCP)(analysis_type: "file_analysis", query: "path/to/file.go")
```

**Features:**
- Complexity metrics (lines, functions, classes, variables)
- Import/export analysis
- Code quality metrics
- Actionable recommendations
- Language detection

**Example:**
```bash
● project_analysis (MCP)(analysis_type: "file_analysis", query: "mcpserver/tools/project_analysis.go")
```

**Sample Output:**
```
=== FILE ANALYSIS ===

Language: go
Symbols found: 16

COMPLEXITY METRICS:
  Total Lines: 968
  Functions: 15
  Classes: 0

```

### 2. Pattern Analysis (`pattern_analysis`)

Detects and analyzes code patterns and consistency across the project.

**Usage:**
```bash
● project_analysis (MCP)(analysis_type: "pattern_analysis", query: "pattern_type")
```

**Supported Pattern Types:**

```

### 4. Symbol Relationships (`symbol_relationships`)

Analyze symbol dependencies, usage patterns, and impact analysis.

**Usage:**
```bash
● project_analysis (MCP)(analysis_type: "symbol_relationships", query: "symbol_name")
```

**Features:**
- Reference and definition counts

```

### 5. Workspace Symbols (`workspace_symbols`)

**Usage:**
```bash
● project_analysis (MCP)(analysis_type: "workspace_symbols", query: "symbol_name")
```

**Features:**

● project_analysis (MCP)(analysis_type: "workspace_analysis", query: "entire_project")

# Explore symbols in a module

```

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
- Use specific queries rather than wildcards when possible
- Leverage pagination for large result sets
- Cache results when performing multiple related analyses

### Analysis Strategy
- Start with `workspace_analysis` for project overview
- Use `file_analysis` for detailed file understanding
- Use `symbol_relationships` before major refactoring
- Regular `pattern_analysis` to maintain code quality

## Multi-Language Support

The analysis automatically detects and works with multiple programming languages:
- Go, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C/C++, Rust, and more...

Example with Python file:
```bash
● project_analysis (MCP)(analysis_type: "file_analysis", query: "scripts/test_mcp_tools.py")
```
